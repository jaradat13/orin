orin.collectors – System Telemetry Harvesters
==============================================
Each module in this package is responsible for extracting one category of raw
system state data from the Linux kernel interfaces (``/proc``, ``/etc``, …).
All public functions return plain Python lists-of-dicts so results can be
persisted directly into the Orin SQLite vault.

Modules
-------
connections       – Listening TCP/UDP ports and active outbound TCP connections.
crontabs          – User and system crontab schedules and scripts parser.
deleted_binaries  – Recover running process executable images flagged as deleted.
dns_forensics     – DNS query tracking, DGA detection, and tunneling analysis.
integrity         – SHA-256 checksums for critical system files and directories.
kernel            – Loaded Linux kernel modules read from ``/proc/modules``.
logs              – Authentication-log parser (brute-force attempts, privilege changes).
parallel          – Thread pool executor for independent collectors with timeouts.
persistence       – SSH ``authorized_keys`` inventory across all system accounts.
pkg_integrity     – Recalculates on-disk binary hashes to compare vs. dpkg records.
processes         – Full process tree harvested from ``/proc/[pid]`` entries.
promisc           – Promiscuous mode interface flags auditor.
session_audit     – Binary login/session auditor parser for wtmp and lastlog structures.
users             – System account profiles parsed directly from ``/etc/passwd``.

Parallel Collection
-------------------
The ``parallel`` module provides thread-pool based concurrent execution of
independent collectors. Use ``ParallelCollector`` for fine-grained control
or ``gather_parallel_system_state()`` for a simple high-level API::

    from orin.collectors.parallel import ParallelCollector

    collector = ParallelCollector(max_workers=4)
    collector.add_task(\"processes\", gather_active_processes, timeout=60)
    collector.add_task(\"ports\", gather_listening_ports, timeout=30)
    results = collector.run()

    # Or use the convenience function:
    from orin.collectors.parallel import gather_parallel_system_state
    successful, failed = gather_parallel_system_state(
        max_workers=4,
        timeout=60.0
    )
